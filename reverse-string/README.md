# Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array
of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Example 1:

**Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]

**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]


## Example 2:

**Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]

**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


## Constraints:
* <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
* `s[i]` is a [printable ASCII character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

## Instructions for Running my Solution:
Requires Python 3.10 or higher.

1. Invoke the Python interpreter
2. Import the `solution.py` module
3. Instantiate the module's `Solution` class
4. Invoke the instance's `reverseString` method with input `s`.
